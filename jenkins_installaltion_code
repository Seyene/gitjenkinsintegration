Using Ubuntu
Jenkins requires Java to function, but Jenkins won't work with just any release of Java. Here's how to install a version of Jenkins that will make the installation and usage of Jenkins possible:

Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu server.
apt-get update
Issue the command sudo apt install default-jdk (to install java).
Allow the installation to complete.
Note: The above installation can take some time, so be patient.

To verify Java has been installed, issue the command:
java --version
You should see that Java has, indeed, been installed (Figure A).

How to install Jenkins
Next we install Jenkins. Go back to your terminal window and follow these steps:

Download and install the necessary GPG key with the command wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -.
Add the necessary repository with the command sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'.
Add the universe repository with the command sudo add-apt-repository universe.
Update apt with the command sudo apt-get update.
Install Jenkins with the command sudo apt-get install jenkins -y.
Allow the installation to complete.

How to access Jenkins
Open a web browser and point it to http://IP:8080 (where IP is the IP address of the hosting server). You will then be prompted to copy and paste a password that was created during the Jenkins installation. To retrieve that password, go back to the terminal window and issue the command:

sudo less /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
